# Runkeeper

<h3> Runkeeper App Purpose </h3>

 <p>In this application, I aimed to show the user's instant location tracking, the number of steps, the distance traveled and the calories burned. I used react-native-maps and react-native-geolocation-service packages for this. 
  
<h3> Packages Used in Runkeeper App </h3>
  
 <p>I used @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/native-stack packages for navigation structure. I used the formic package because there are too many input operations. I kept the information from the user in the @react-native-firebase package. I used the react-native-flash-message package to show the user when any error occurs. I used the react-native-share package so that the user can share their information. I used react-native-vector-icons and react-native-elements packages for better visual experience. Finally, I used the redux package for the Context structure.
